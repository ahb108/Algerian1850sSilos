## % Change for tribes with overlap

rawchange ## 964 more silos in 1853 where tribes overlap
perchange ## 4.8% more silos in 1853 where tribes overlap

## Now estimate th 1854 count for the missing tribes and create a final rconstructed 1854 count.

## Hence implied silo pit size assuming the whole harvest went into these pits
35000000/22000 #lower estimate
40000000/22000 #higher estimate
